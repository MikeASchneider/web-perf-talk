A talk I gave for Brand Networks on January 16, 2015 about web performance.

[PDF version available here](https://github.com/MikeASchneider/web-perf-talk/blob/master/web-perf.pdf?raw=true). If you prefer plain text, you can use the web-perf.md file.

This talk was created with [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) for Mac. If you'd like to take a look at the Deckset-flavored markdown file (with `[fit]` tags and such), use the web-perf-deckset.md file.
